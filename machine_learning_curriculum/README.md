# Machine Learning Curriculum

This curriculum was developed by Chris George, Stephen Tsou, and Amal Nanavati in Fall 2017. It is being piloted in South Fayette High School in Spring 2018, taught by Stephen Tsou and Eric Zhu.

This curriculum is targetted to post AP Computer Science A students, or advanced students who have taken an introductory computer science class. It focuses on the algorithmic aspects of machine learning, and teaches decision trees, the weighted majority algorithm, and k nearest neighbors. This is currently a working curriculum, and is being modified as the course is  taught.
